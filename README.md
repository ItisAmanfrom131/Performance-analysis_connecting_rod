This repository contains the results and source files for a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) study on the performance, stress, and strain distribution of an Internal Combustion (IC) Engine Connecting Rod.

🎯 1. Project Goal
The primary objective of this study was to analyze the structural performance of the connecting rod under realistic engine operating conditions. Specifically, the analysis aimed to:

Determine the Maximum Equivalent (Von Mises) Stress distribution.

Evaluate the Total Deformation under peak loading conditions.

Assess the Factor of Safety (FOS) for the component.

Validate the design against the mechanical properties of the chosen material.

🛠️ 2. Methodology and Simulation Details
The structural analysis was performed using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software (e.g., ANSYS, Abaqus, SolidWorks Simulation).

A. Component Specifications
Component: IC Engine Connecting Rod

Design File: connecting rod cad design.jpg \

Material Used: Carbon Steel AISI 1045

Material Properties Source: stress vs strain surve of carbon aisi1045.xlsx - Sheet1.csv

B. Loading and Boundary Conditions
The simulation modeled the two critical loading scenarios a connecting rod experiences:

Compression Load (Peak Firing Pressure): The maximum force generated during the power stroke.

Tension Load (Inertia Forces): The maximum tensile force generated by the mass of the piston assembly at the exhaust stroke.


The boundary conditions included:

Pin joints constrained for rotational freedom at the Piston End (Small End) and the Crank End (Big End).
